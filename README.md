Setup:
install nodejs, npm
install heroku toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com)


after cloning repository:
npm install      (this should install all of the project dependencies like express etc)


to start locally (from project root):
DEBUG=myapp npm start    (mac or linux)
set DEBUG=myapp & npm start    (windows)


navigate to localhost:3000 in a browswer to solve a sweet puzzle


(currently working on getting everything setup with heroku- will add more instructions to this)
